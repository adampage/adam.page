I’m currently developing this website in the open.  Please drop by occasionally
to see what’s new!

## Contact

As soon as I get my act together, I’ll have some robust contact-related content
here.  In the meantime, if you happen to have discovered an issue on this
website and wouldn’t mind sharing a few words about it (and already have a
[GitHub](https://github.com/) user account), please feel free to [create an
issue at my public repo](https://github.com/adampage/adam.page/issues/new).

There is also some stale info about me at [adampage.net](http://adampage.net).
